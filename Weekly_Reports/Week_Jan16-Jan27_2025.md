### Overview
During this period, I focused on implementing Monte Carlo Log-Likelihood estimation techniques for a Generative Adversarial Autoencoder (GAN-AE) model. This task involved understanding the theoretical foundations of the technique, implementing it in code, and tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

#### 3. Documentation and Reporting

- Created detailed documentation for:
  - Mathematical foundations of the implementation
  - Code structure and usage instructions
  - Experimental results and analysis
  - Recommendations for future improvements

- Prepared a presentation summarizing:
  - The Monte Carlo Log-Likelihood approach
  - Implementation challenges and solutions
  - Hyperparameter tuning results
  - Comparative analysis with baseline methods

### Key Insights

1. **Estimation Accuracy vs. Computational Cost**:
   - Increasing Monte Carlo sample size beyond 1000 samples provided diminishing returns in estimation accuracy while significantly increasing computational cost
   - Annealed importance sampling provided more reliable estimates than standard importance sampling, especially for complex data distributions

2. **Training Stability**:
   - Learning rates below 5e-4 were crucial for stable GAN-AE training
   - Gradient clipping at a threshold of 1.0 significantly improved training stability
   - Spectral normalization in the discriminator was essential for preventing mode collapse

3. **Model Architecture Insights**:
   - Deeper encoder/decoder networks did not necessarily improve performance
   - Skip connections in the autoencoder improved reconstruction quality without harming adversarial training
   - Batch normalization in the generator and spectral normalization in the discriminator provided the best stability

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Computational Efficiency**:
   - Monte Carlo estimation was computationally intensive, requiring optimization of the sampling procedure
   - Implemented parallel processing to mitigate computational bottlenecks

2. **Numerical Stability**:
   - Log-likelihood estimates occasionally suffered from numerical instability
   - Implemented log-sum-exp tricks and proper normalization to address these issues

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**:
   - GAN-AE training was highly sensitive to learning rate and discriminator update frequency
   - Developed a robust training protocol to address sensitivity issues

### Next Steps

1. Extend the implementation to handle more complex datasets
2. Investigate alternative sampling strategies for more efficient likelihood estimation
3. Compare the GAN-AE model with other generative models using the implemented likelihood estimation
4. Prepare a comprehensive report on the findings for publication
