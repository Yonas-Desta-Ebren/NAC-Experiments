### Key Insights

1. **Distribution Impact**:
   - Non-Gaussian distributions can significantly impact model robustness
   - Heavy-tailed distributions (e.g., Student's t) provide better handling of outliers
   - Different distributions create different inductive biases in the model
   - The choice of distribution should be informed by data characteristics

2. **Mathematical Extensions**:
   - The predictive coding framework can be naturally extended to non-Gaussian distributions
   - Update rules require modification based on the specific distribution
   - The core principles of prediction error minimization remain consistent
   - Computational complexity increases with more complex distributions

3. **Practical Advantages**:
   - Non-Gaussian models show improved robustness to outliers and noise
   - They can better capture multi-modal data distributions
   - Performance improvements are most significant on datasets with non-Gaussian characteristics
   - The advantages come with increased computational requirements

4. **Implementation Considerations**:
   - Numerical stability is a key concern for some distributions
   - Efficient implementation requires careful consideration of distribution-specific operations
   - Hyperparameter sensitivity may increase with non-Gaussian models
   - Testing and validation procedures need to be adapted

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Mathematical Complexity**:
   - Some derivations for non-Gaussian update rules were mathematically complex
   - Required reviewing advanced statistical concepts
   - Created supplementary study materials to address these challenges

2. **Conceptual Integration**:
   - Integrating non-Gaussian concepts with existing predictive coding knowledge
   - Understanding the implications of distribution changes on the overall framework
   - Addressed through systematic comparison and mapping of concepts

3. **Implementation Visualization**:
   - Difficulty visualizing how theoretical changes would manifest in code
   - Limited implementation details in the paper
   - Began sketching pseudocode to bridge this gap

### Next Steps
