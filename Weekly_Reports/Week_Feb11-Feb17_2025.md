   - The improvement was more significant for the binary classification task (+1.8%) than for MNIST (+0.6%)
   - The additional node allowed for more hierarchical feature extraction

2. **Convergence Behavior**:
   - The 4-node model required more epochs to converge but reached a better optimum
   - Learning dynamics showed more stable progression with the deeper architecture
   - The deeper model showed better generalization on the test set

3. **Computational Trade-offs**:
   - The performance improvements came at a cost of approximately 15% increase in computational resources
   - The trade-off was favorable, with performance gains outweighing the computational cost
   - The modified architecture maintained real-time inference capabilities

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Implementation Complexity**:
   - Modifying the NGC architecture required careful adjustment of multiple interconnected components
   - Ensuring proper gradient flow through the new layer required detailed debugging
   - Maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase was challenging

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**:
   - The deeper model showed increased sensitivity to learning rate
   - Required more careful tuning of regularization parameters
   - Inference iterations needed adjustment to accommodate the additional layer

3. **Evaluation Methodology**:
   - Ensuring fair comparison between models required consistent evaluation protocols
   - Needed to account for random initialization effects through multiple training runs
