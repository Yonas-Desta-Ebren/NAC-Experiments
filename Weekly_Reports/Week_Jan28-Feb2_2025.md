# Weekly Progress Report
## January 28 - February 2, 2025

### Overview
This week, I focused on comprehensive parameter exploration for the GAN-AE model, conducting systematic experiments to analyze how different parameter configurations affect model convergence and performance. I documented all experimental results in detail to provide insights for future optimization.

### Tasks Completed

#### 1. Systematic Parameter Exploration

- **Learning Rate Analysis**:
  - Conducted fine-grained learning rate sweep within the paper-specified range [1e-5, 1e-3]
  - Tested learning rates: 1e-5, 3e-5, 1e-4, 3e-4, 5e-4, 8e-4, 1e-3
  - For each learning rate, ran 5 training sessions with different random seeds to assess stability
  - Analyzed convergence patterns, training stability, and final performance metrics
  - **Key Finding**: Learning rates between 3e-4 and 5e-4 provided the best balance between convergence speed and stability

- **Sigma Parameter Optimization**:
  - Explored the noise parameter sigma within range [0.01, 1.0] as specified in the paper
  - Tested values: 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0
  - Analyzed the effect on:
    - Sample diversity
    - Mode coverage
    - Training stability
    - Log-likelihood estimates
  - **Key Finding**: Sigma values around 0.1-0.2 provided optimal results, with higher values leading to excessive blurriness and lower values causing mode collapse

- **Batch Size Experimentation**:
  - Tested batch sizes: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256
  - Analyzed impact on:
    - Training speed
    - Gradient stability
    - Generalization performance
    - Memory requirements
  - **Key Finding**: Batch size of 64 provided the best trade-off between training stability and computational efficiency

- **Network Architecture Variations**:
  - Tested different layer configurations within the encoder and decoder
  - Explored latent dimensions: 32, 64, 128, 256
  - Analyzed the effect of skip connections
  - Experimented with different activation functions (ReLU, LeakyReLU, GELU)
  - **Key Finding**: Latent dimension of 128 with LeakyReLU activations (alpha=0.2) provided optimal results

#### 2. Experimental Documentation and Analysis

- **Comprehensive Logging System**:
  - Implemented detailed logging of all training metrics
  - Recorded parameter configurations, training curves, and evaluation metrics
  - Created a structured database of experimental results for easy comparison

- **Visualization Dashboard**:
  - Developed interactive visualizations for parameter impact analysis
  - Created plots showing:
    - Learning curves for different parameter configurations
    - Reconstruction quality across parameter settings
    - Sample diversity metrics
    - Log-likelihood estimates

- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Conducted ANOVA tests to determine statistically significant parameter effects
  - Calculated effect sizes for each parameter
  - Performed interaction analysis between parameters
  - **Key Finding**: Learning rate and sigma had the largest effect sizes, with significant interaction between them

#### 3. Performance Metrics Analysis

- **Quantitative Metrics**:
  - Calculated and compared across parameter configurations:
    - Reconstruction error (MSE, SSIM)
    - Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID)
    - Inception Score (IS)
    - Monte Carlo Log-Likelihood estimates
    - Training time and convergence speed

- **Qualitative Assessment**:
  - Generated samples across parameter configurations
  - Conducted latent space interpolation studies
  - Analyzed reconstruction quality on test samples
  - Examined failure cases and artifacts

#### 4. Optimal Configuration Determination

- Based on comprehensive analysis, identified the optimal parameter configuration:
  - Learning rate: 4e-4
  - Sigma: 0.15
  - Batch size: 64
  - Latent dimension: 128
  - Discriminator updates per generator update: 2
  - Activation function: LeakyReLU (alpha=0.2)
  - Weight initialization: Kaiming normal

- Validated the optimal configuration with:
  - 10 independent training runs with different random seeds
  - Cross-dataset validation
  - Comparison to baseline results from the original paper

### Key Insights

1. **Parameter Sensitivity**:
   - The GAN-AE model showed high sensitivity to learning rate and sigma parameter
   - Training stability was significantly affected by the interaction between learning rate and batch size
   - Larger latent dimensions improved reconstruction quality but with diminishing returns beyond 128

2. **Convergence Patterns**:
   - Identified three distinct convergence patterns across parameter configurations:
     - Stable convergence (optimal parameters)
     - Oscillatory behavior (learning rate too high)
     - Premature convergence (learning rate too low)
   - Early training dynamics (first 1000 iterations) were highly predictive of final performance

3. **Trade-offs**:
   - Documented clear trade-offs between:
     - Sample quality vs. diversity
     - Training speed vs. stability
     - Model capacity vs. generalization
   - Provided quantitative measures for each trade-off to guide future implementations

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Computational Resources**:
   - The extensive parameter sweep required significant computational resources
   - Implemented efficient parallelization strategies to maximize GPU utilization

2. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Some metrics (particularly FID) showed high variance across runs
   - Addressed by increasing the number of evaluation samples and averaging across multiple runs

3. **Hyperparameter Interactions**:
   - Complex interactions between parameters made optimization challenging
   - Used factorial design principles to systematically explore interaction effects

### Next Steps

1. Implement the optimal configuration for the full-scale model training
2. Explore adaptive parameter scheduling during training
3. Investigate transfer learning capabilities with the optimized model
4. Prepare a comprehensive report on parameter sensitivity for the research team
