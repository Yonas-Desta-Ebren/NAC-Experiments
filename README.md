# Neural Generative Coding (NGC) Experiments

## Overview

This research project aims to replicate and evaluate the Neural Generative Coding (NGC) framework proposed by Ororbia and Kifer [The Neural Coding Framework for Learning Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03405). The study provides a biologically inspired alternative to traditional backpropagation for training generative models.

## Background 

The NGC framework is rooted in predictive processing theory, offering a novel approach to machine learning that draws inspiration from biological neural systems. Unlike conventional training methods, NGC presents a unique perspective on how neural networks can learn and generate representations.

## Research Objectives 
- Replicate the NGC models described in the original research
- Evaluate performance on benchmark datasets
- Compare results with the original study's findings
- Analyze model performance across key metrics

## Key Metrics of Evaluation
1. **Reconstruction Quality**
2. **Likelihood Estimation**
3. **Classification Capability**
