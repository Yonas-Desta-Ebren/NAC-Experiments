# Comprehensive Comparison of Generative Models

This document provides a detailed comparison of the different generative models we've studied, including Neural Generative Coding (NGC) models, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Regularized Autoencoders (RAEs).

## 1. Model Architectures

### 1.1 Neural Generative Coding (NGC) Models

NGC models are based on the predictive coding theory from neuroscience. They have a hierarchical structure where each layer tries to predict the activity of the layer below it, and learning is driven by prediction errors.

#### GNCN-PDH
- Uses Predictive Discrete Hebbian learning
- Activation function: tanh
- Output function: sigmoid
- Latent dimension: 360
- Top latent dimension: 360
- Iterative settling process with K=50 steps

#### GNCN-t1
- A variant of NGC with a different architecture
- Activation function: tanh
- Output function: sigmoid
- Latent dimension: 360
- Top latent dimension: 360
- Iterative settling process with K=50 steps

#### GNCN-t1-Sigma
- Extends GNCN-t1 with variance parameters
- Activation function: relu
- Output function: sigmoid
- Latent dimension: 360
- Top latent dimension: 360
- Iterative settling process with K=50 steps

### 1.2 Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

VAEs are probabilistic generative models that learn to encode data into a latent space and then decode it back to the original space.

#### GVAE (Gaussian VAE)
- Encoder: Maps input to mean and variance of approximate posterior
- Latent distribution: Gaussian with learned mean and variance
- Decoder: Maps latent samples to reconstructed input
- Prior distribution: Standard normal

#### GVAE-CV (Gaussian VAE with Constant Variance)
- Encoder: Maps input to mean of approximate posterior
- Latent distribution: Gaussian with learned mean and fixed variance
- Decoder: Maps latent samples to reconstructed input
- Prior distribution: Standard normal

### 1.3 Regularized Autoencoders (RAEs)

RAEs are deterministic autoencoders with explicit regularization.

#### RAE
- Encoder: Maps input directly to latent representation
- Decoder: Maps latent representation to reconstructed input
- Regularization: L2 regularization on weights

## 2. Learning Mechanisms

### 2.1 NGC Models

NGC models use local learning rules based on prediction errors:

1. **State Update Rule**:
   $$\Delta \mathbf{s}^l = \eta_s \left( \mathbf{W}^l \mathbf{e}^{l-1} - \mathbf{e}^l \right)$$

2. **Weight Update Rule**:
   $$\Delta \mathbf{W}^l = \eta_W \mathbf{e}^{l-1} (\mathbf{s}^l)^T - \lambda \mathbf{W}^l$$

3. **Iterative Settling**: The network goes through K iterations of state updates before applying weight updates.

### 2.2 VAEs

VAEs use backpropagation to optimize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):

$$\text{ELBO}(\phi, \theta) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|x)}[\log p_\theta(x|z)] - \text{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) || p(z))$$

The reparameterization trick is used to enable backpropagation through the sampling process:

$$z = \mu_\phi(x) + \sigma_\phi(x) \odot \epsilon$$

### 2.3 RAEs

RAEs use backpropagation to optimize a reconstruction loss with explicit regularization:

$$\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; x) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}}(x, \hat{x}) + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}(x, z, \phi, \theta)$$

## 3. Biological Plausibility

### 3.1 NGC Models

NGC models are designed to be biologically plausible:
- They use local learning rules
- They don't require symmetric weights
- They don't need to store activations from the forward pass
- They involve an iterative settling process that resembles neural dynamics

### 3.2 VAEs and RAEs

VAEs and RAEs use backpropagation, which is not considered biologically plausible:
- It requires propagating error signals backward through the network
- It needs symmetric weights between forward and backward passes
- It involves non-local computations
- It requires storing activations from the forward pass
