## 1. Neural Generative Coding (NGC) Models

### 1.1 Theoretical Framework

Neural Generative Coding (NGC) is based on the predictive coding theory from neuroscience, which posits that the brain is constantly trying to predict its sensory inputs and updates its internal models based on prediction errors.

In NGC, the network consists of multiple layers, each trying to predict the activity of the layer below it. The prediction errors drive the learning process through local learning rules, making it more biologically plausible than backpropagation.

### 1.2 Mathematical Formulation

Consider a hierarchical generative model with $L$ layers. For each layer $l$, we have:
- State variables $\mathbf{s}^l$
- Prediction of the layer below $\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{l-1} = f^l(\mathbf{s}^l)$
- Prediction error $\mathbf{e}^{l-1} = \mathbf{s}^{l-1} - \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{l-1}$

The state update rule for layer $l$ is:

$$\Delta \mathbf{s}^l = \eta_s \left( \mathbf{W}^l \mathbf{e}^{l-1} - \mathbf{e}^l \right)$$

Where:
- $\eta_s$ is the state update learning rate
- $\mathbf{W}^l$ is the weight matrix for layer $l$
- $\mathbf{e}^{l-1}$ is the prediction error from the layer below
- $\mathbf{e}^l$ is the prediction error from the layer above

The weight update rule follows a Hebbian-like learning rule:

$$\Delta \mathbf{W}^l = \eta_W \mathbf{e}^{l-1} (\mathbf{s}^l)^T$$

Where $\eta_W$ is the weight update learning rate.

### 1.3 GNCN-PDH Model

GNCN-PDH (Generative Neural Coding Network with Predictive Discrete Hebbian learning) is an implementation of NGC that uses local Hebbian-like learning rules.

The PDH learning rule can be written as:

$$\Delta \mathbf{W}^l = \eta_W \mathbf{e}^{l-1} (\mathbf{s}^l)^T - \lambda \mathbf{W}^l$$

Where $\lambda$ is a weight decay parameter for regularization.

The iterative settling process in GNCN-PDH involves:

1. Initialize state variables $\mathbf{s}^l$ for all layers
2. For $K$ steps:
   a. Compute predictions $\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{l-1} = f^l(\mathbf{s}^l)$ for all layers
   b. Compute prediction errors $\mathbf{e}^{l-1} = \mathbf{s}^{l-1} - \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{l-1}$ for all layers
   c. Update state variables $\mathbf{s}^l = \mathbf{s}^l + \Delta \mathbf{s}^l$ for all layers
3. Update weights $\mathbf{W}^l = \mathbf{W}^l + \Delta \mathbf{W}^l$ for all layers

### 1.4 GNCN-t1 and GNCN-t1-Sigma Models

GNCN-t1 is a variant of NGC with a different architecture. The key difference is in how the layers are connected and how the predictions are computed.

GNCN-t1-Sigma extends GNCN-t1 by including variance parameters (sigma) in the model. This allows the model to capture uncertainty in its predictions.

The prediction in GNCN-t1-Sigma is:

$$\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{l-1} = f^l(\mathbf{s}^l, \boldsymbol{\sigma}^l)$$

Where $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^l$ are the variance parameters for layer $l$.

The state update rule is modified to include the variance:

$$\Delta \mathbf{s}^l = \eta_s \left( \mathbf{W}^l \frac{\mathbf{e}^{l-1}}{(\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{l-1})^2} - \frac{\mathbf{e}^l}{(\boldsymbol{\sigma}^l)^2} \right)$$

And the weight update rule becomes:

$$\Delta \mathbf{W}^l = \eta_W \frac{\mathbf{e}^{l-1}}{(\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{l-1})^2} (\mathbf{s}^l)^T - \lambda \mathbf{W}^l$$

## 2. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

### 2.1 Probabilistic Framework

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are latent variable models that aim to learn the underlying data distribution $p(x)$ by introducing a latent variable $z$. The joint distribution is factorized as:

$$p(x, z) = p(x|z)p(z)$$

Where:
- $p(z)$ is the prior distribution over latent variables (typically a standard normal distribution)
- $p(x|z)$ is the likelihood of the data given the latent variables (decoder)

The marginal likelihood $p(x)$ is obtained by integrating over all possible values of $z$:

$$p(x) = \int p(x|z)p(z) dz$$

This integral is generally intractable, so VAEs use variational inference to approximate it.

### 2.2 Variational Inference

VAEs introduce an approximate posterior distribution $q_\phi(z|x)$ (encoder) to approximate the true posterior $p(z|x)$. The goal is to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these distributions:

$$\text{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) || p(z|x))$$

This can be reformulated to maximize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):

$$\text{ELBO}(\phi, \theta) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|x)}[\log p_\theta(x|z)] - \text{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) || p(z))$$

Where:
- $\phi$ are the parameters of the encoder network
- $\theta$ are the parameters of the decoder network
- The first term is the reconstruction term (how well the model reconstructs the input)
- The second term is the regularization term (how close the approximate posterior is to the prior)

### 2.3 Reparameterization Trick

To enable backpropagation through the sampling process, VAEs use the reparameterization trick. Instead of directly sampling from $q_\phi(z|x)$, we parameterize it as:

$$z = \mu_\phi(x) + \sigma_\phi(x) \odot \epsilon$$

Where:
- $\mu_\phi(x)$ is the mean of the approximate posterior
- $\sigma_\phi(x)$ is the standard deviation of the approximate posterior
- $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$ is a random noise vector
- $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication

This allows gradients to flow through the deterministic parameters $\mu_\phi(x)$ and $\sigma_\phi(x)$.

### 2.4 Gaussian VAE (GVAE)

In a Gaussian VAE, both the prior and approximate posterior are Gaussian distributions:

$$p(z) = \mathcal{N}(z; 0, I)$$
$$q_\phi(z|x) = \mathcal{N}(z; \mu_\phi(x), \text{diag}(\sigma^2_\phi(x)))$$

The decoder defines a likelihood function, which for MNIST (binary data) is typically a Bernoulli distribution:

$$p_\theta(x|z) = \prod_{i=1}^D \text{Bern}(x_i; f_\theta(z)_i)$$

Where $f_\theta(z)$ is the output of the decoder network, representing the parameters of the Bernoulli distribution (probabilities).

### 2.5 GVAE with Constant Variance (GVAE-CV)

GVAE-CV is a simplified version of GVAE where the variance of the approximate posterior is fixed to a constant value:

$$q_\phi(z|x) = \mathcal{N}(z; \mu_\phi(x), \sigma^2 I)$$

Where $\sigma^2$ is a fixed hyperparameter (e.g., $\sigma^2 = 1$).

With a constant variance, the KL divergence term simplifies to:

$$\text{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) || p(z)) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^J \left( \mu_j^2 + \sigma^2 - \log(\sigma^2) - 1 \right)$$

If $\sigma^2 = 1$, this further simplifies to:

$$\text{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) || p(z)) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^J \mu_j^2$$

This is equivalent to L2 regularization on the means of the approximate posterior.

## 3. Regularized Autoencoders (RAEs)

### 3.1 Deterministic Framework

Unlike VAEs, Regularized Autoencoders (RAEs) are deterministic models that do not use a probabilistic framework. They directly map inputs to a latent representation and back:

$$z = f_\phi(x)$$
$$\hat{x} = g_\theta(z)$$

Where:
- $f_\phi$ is the encoder function with parameters $\phi$
- $g_\theta$ is the decoder function with parameters $\theta$

### 3.2 Loss Function

The loss function for RAE consists of a reconstruction term and a regularization term:

$$\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; x) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}}(x, \hat{x}) + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}(x, z, \phi, \theta)$$

For binary data like MNIST, the reconstruction term is typically the binary cross-entropy:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}}(x, \hat{x}) = \text{BCE}(x, \hat{x})$$

The regularization term can take various forms. In our implementation, we use L2 regularization on the weights:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}(x, z, \phi, \theta) = \|\phi\|_2^2 + \|\theta\|_2^2$$

Where $\|\cdot\|_2^2$ denotes the squared L2 norm.

## 4. Comparison of Learning Rules

### 4.1 Backpropagation (Used in GVAE, GVAE-CV, RAE)

Backpropagation computes gradients of the loss function with respect to all parameters by applying the chain rule of calculus:

$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \hat{x}} \frac{\partial \hat{x}}{\partial \theta}$$
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \phi} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z} \frac{\partial z}{\partial \phi}$$

This requires propagating error signals backward through the network, which is not considered biologically plausible because:
1. It requires symmetric weights between forward and backward passes
2. It needs to store activations from the forward pass
3. It involves non-local computations

### 4.2 Hebbian Learning (Used in NGC Models)

Hebbian learning follows the principle "neurons that fire together, wire together." The basic Hebbian rule is:

$$\Delta W_{ij} = \eta x_i y_j$$

Where:
- $W_{ij}$ is the weight connecting neurons $i$ and $j$
- $x_i$ is the activity of the pre-synaptic neuron
- $y_j$ is the activity of the post-synaptic neuron
- $\eta$ is the learning rate

This is a local learning rule, meaning the update for a weight depends only on the activities of the neurons it connects, making it more biologically plausible.

### 4.3 Predictive Coding (Used in NGC Models)

Predictive coding combines Hebbian learning with prediction errors. The weight update rule is:

$$\Delta W_{ij} = \eta e_j x_i$$

Where $e_j$ is the prediction error at neuron $j$.

This learning rule is still local and more biologically plausible than backpropagation, while potentially being more powerful than simple Hebbian learning.

## 5. Interview Questions and Answers

### 5.1 Neural Generative Coding (NGC)

**Q1: What is Neural Generative Coding and how does it differ from traditional neural networks?**

A1: Neural Generative Coding (NGC) is a biologically inspired approach to neural networks based on the predictive coding theory from neuroscience. The key differences from traditional neural networks are:

1. **Learning Mechanism**: NGC uses local learning rules based on prediction errors, while traditional neural networks typically use backpropagation, which requires global error propagation.

2. **Biological Plausibility**: NGC is more biologically plausible because it uses local learning rules that are more consistent with how learning might occur in the brain.

3. **Architecture**: NGC models have a hierarchical structure where each layer tries to predict the activity of the layer below it, and learning is driven by prediction errors.

4. **Dynamics**: NGC models involve an iterative settling process where the network converges to a stable state before weight updates are applied.

**Q2: Explain the mathematical formulation of the GNCN-PDH model.**

A2: The GNCN-PDH (Generative Neural Coding Network with Predictive Discrete Hebbian learning) model is formulated as follows:

1. **State Variables**: Each layer $l$ has state variables $\mathbf{s}^l$.

2. **Predictions**: Each layer predicts the activity of the layer below it: $\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{l-1} = f^l(\mathbf{s}^l)$.

3. **Prediction Errors**: The prediction error at each layer is: $\mathbf{e}^{l-1} = \mathbf{s}^{l-1} - \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{l-1}$.

4. **State Update Rule**: The state variables are updated based on prediction errors:
   $$\Delta \mathbf{s}^l = \eta_s \left( \mathbf{W}^l \mathbf{e}^{l-1} - \mathbf{e}^l \right)$$

5. **Weight Update Rule**: The weights are updated using a Hebbian-like rule:
   $$\Delta \mathbf{W}^l = \eta_W \mathbf{e}^{l-1} (\mathbf{s}^l)^T - \lambda \mathbf{W}^l$$

6. **Iterative Settling**: The network goes through $K$ iterations of state updates before applying weight updates.

**Q3: How does GNCN-t1-Sigma differ from GNCN-PDH?**

A3: GNCN-t1-Sigma differs from GNCN-PDH in several ways:

1. **Variance Parameters**: GNCN-t1-Sigma includes variance parameters (sigma) that capture uncertainty in the predictions.

2. **Prediction Formulation**: The predictions in GNCN-t1-Sigma incorporate the variance parameters:
   $$\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{l-1} = f^l(\mathbf{s}^l, \boldsymbol{\sigma}^l)$$

3. **State Update Rule**: The state update rule is modified to include the variance:
   $$\Delta \mathbf{s}^l = \eta_s \left( \mathbf{W}^l \frac{\mathbf{e}^{l-1}}{(\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{l-1})^2} - \frac{\mathbf{e}^l}{(\boldsymbol{\sigma}^l)^2} \right)$$

4. **Weight Update Rule**: The weight update rule also incorporates the variance:
   $$\Delta \mathbf{W}^l = \eta_W \frac{\mathbf{e}^{l-1}}{(\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{l-1})^2} (\mathbf{s}^l)^T - \lambda \mathbf{W}^l$$

5. **Activation Function**: GNCN-t1-Sigma uses ReLU activation, while GNCN-PDH uses tanh activation.

**Q4: What are the advantages and disadvantages of NGC models compared to backpropagation-based models?**

A4: Advantages of NGC models:

1. **Biological Plausibility**: NGC models use local learning rules that are more consistent with how learning might occur in the brain.

2. **No Need for Backpropagation**: NGC models don't require the biologically implausible backward pass of error signals.

3. **Online Learning**: NGC models can naturally perform online learning, updating weights as new data arrives.

4. **Interpretability**: The predictive coding framework provides a clear interpretation of what the network is doing.

Disadvantages of NGC models:

1. **Computational Complexity**: The iterative settling process can be computationally expensive.

2. **Convergence Issues**: NGC models may have more complex convergence properties and can be sensitive to hyperparameters.

3. **Performance Gap**: There can be a performance gap compared to state-of-the-art backpropagation-based models.

4. **Less Mature**: NGC models are less mature and have been less extensively studied than backpropagation-based models.

### 5.2 Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

**Q5: What is a Variational Autoencoder and how does it work?**

A5: A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a generative model that learns to encode data into a latent space and then decode it back to the original space. It works as follows:

1. **Encoder**: The encoder network maps input data $x$ to parameters of an approximate posterior distribution $q_\phi(z|x)$ over latent variables $z$.

2. **Sampling**: Latent variables $z$ are sampled from the approximate posterior $q_\phi(z|x)$ using the reparameterization trick.

3. **Decoder**: The decoder network maps latent variables $z$ back to the original data space, producing a reconstruction $\hat{x}$.

4. **Loss Function**: The model is trained to maximize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):
   $$\text{ELBO}(\phi, \theta) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|x)}[\log p_\theta(x|z)] - \text{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) || p(z))$$

5. **Generative Process**: After training, new data can be generated by sampling from the prior $p(z)$ and passing the samples through the decoder.

**Q6: Explain the reparameterization trick in VAEs.**

A6: The reparameterization trick is a technique used in VAEs to enable backpropagation through the sampling process. Instead of directly sampling from the approximate posterior $q_\phi(z|x)$, we parameterize the sampling as:

$$z = \mu_\phi(x) + \sigma_\phi(x) \odot \epsilon$$

Where:
- $\mu_\phi(x)$ is the mean of the approximate posterior
- $\sigma_\phi(x)$ is the standard deviation of the approximate posterior
- $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$ is a random noise vector
- $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication

This parameterization allows gradients to flow through the deterministic parameters $\mu_\phi(x)$ and $\sigma_\phi(x)$, while the randomness comes from the noise vector $\epsilon$, which is independent of the parameters.

**Q7: What is the role of the KL divergence term in the VAE objective?**

A7: The KL divergence term in the VAE objective serves several important roles:

1. **Regularization**: It regularizes the approximate posterior $q_\phi(z|x)$ to be close to the prior $p(z)$, preventing overfitting and encouraging a well-behaved latent space.

2. **Information Bottleneck**: It acts as an information bottleneck, limiting the amount of information that can be encoded in the latent variables.

3. **Enabling Generation**: By encouraging the approximate posterior to be close to the prior, it enables generation of new data by sampling from the prior.

4. **Disentanglement**: With appropriate priors, it can encourage disentangled representations where different dimensions of the latent space capture different factors of variation in the data.

**Q8: How does GVAE-CV differ from GVAE, and what are the implications?**

A8: GVAE-CV (Gaussian VAE with Constant Variance) differs from GVAE in that it uses a fixed variance for the approximate posterior, while GVAE learns the variance. The implications are:

1. **Simplified Model**: GVAE-CV has fewer parameters to learn, as it doesn't need to learn the variance.

2. **Simplified KL Divergence**: The KL divergence term simplifies to $\frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^J \mu_j^2$ if $\sigma^2 = 1$, which is equivalent to L2 regularization on the means.

3. **Reconstruction vs. Regularization**: GVAE-CV may achieve better reconstruction performance but potentially worse density estimation compared to GVAE.

4. **Uncertainty Modeling**: GVAE-CV cannot model uncertainty in the latent space as effectively as GVAE.

### 5.3 Regularized Autoencoders (RAEs)

**Q9: What is a Regularized Autoencoder and how does it differ from a VAE?**

A9: A Regularized Autoencoder (RAE) is a deterministic autoencoder with explicit regularization. The key differences from a VAE are:

1. **Deterministic vs. Probabilistic**: RAEs are deterministic models that directly map inputs to latent representations, while VAEs are probabilistic models that learn distributions over latent variables.

2. **Regularization Approach**: RAEs use explicit regularization terms (e.g., L2 regularization on weights), while VAEs use the KL divergence between the approximate posterior and the prior as implicit regularization.

3. **Generation Mechanism**: RAEs don't have a natural generation mechanism, while VAEs can generate new data by sampling from the prior.

4. **Objective Function**: RAEs optimize a simpler objective function that doesn't involve probabilistic terms, while VAEs optimize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO).

**Q10: Why might RAE perform better on reconstruction but worse on density estimation compared to VAEs?**

A10: RAEs may perform better on reconstruction but worse on density estimation compared to VAEs for several reasons:

1. **Direct Optimization**: RAEs directly optimize for reconstruction without the constraints of a probabilistic framework, allowing them to focus solely on minimizing reconstruction error.

2. **No Information Bottleneck**: RAEs don't have the information bottleneck imposed by the KL divergence term in VAEs, allowing them to encode more information in the latent space.

3. **Lack of Probabilistic Framework**: RAEs don't learn a proper probability distribution over the latent space, making density estimation more challenging.

4. **Trade-off in VAEs**: VAEs make an explicit trade-off between reconstruction quality and regularization (via the KL divergence term), which can lead to worse reconstruction but better density estimation.

### 5.4 Comparison of Learning Rules

**Q11: What makes Hebbian learning more biologically plausible than backpropagation?**

A11: Hebbian learning is considered more biologically plausible than backpropagation for several reasons:

1. **Locality**: Hebbian learning is a local learning rule, meaning the update for a weight depends only on the activities of the neurons it connects. In contrast, backpropagation requires propagating error signals backward through the network.

2. **No Need for Symmetric Weights**: Hebbian learning doesn't require symmetric weights between forward and backward passes, which is a biologically implausible requirement of backpropagation.

3. **No Need to Store Activations**: Hebbian learning doesn't need to store activations from the forward pass, which would require a biologically implausible memory mechanism.

4. **Biological Evidence**: There is evidence for Hebbian-like learning mechanisms in biological neurons, while there is little evidence for backpropagation-like mechanisms.

**Q12: Explain the predictive coding theory and how it relates to NGC.**

A12: Predictive coding is a theory from neuroscience that posits that the brain is constantly trying to predict its sensory inputs and updates its internal models based on prediction errors. The key aspects of predictive coding are:

1. **Hierarchical Prediction**: The brain has a hierarchical structure where higher levels predict the activity of lower levels.

2. **Prediction Errors**: The difference between the predicted and actual activity at each level generates prediction errors.

3. **Error-Driven Learning**: These prediction errors drive learning and updating of the internal models.

4. **Top-Down and Bottom-Up Processing**: Information flows both top-down (predictions) and bottom-up (prediction errors).

Neural Generative Coding (NGC) is a computational implementation of predictive coding principles. In NGC:

1. Each layer predicts the activity of the layer below it.
2. Prediction errors are computed as the difference between the actual and predicted activity.
3. These prediction errors drive both the update of state variables (short-term dynamics) and weights (long-term learning).
4. The learning rules are local and Hebbian-like, consistent with biological plausibility.

**Q13: How would you choose between NGC, VAE, and RAE models for a specific application?**

A13: The choice between NGC, VAE, and RAE models depends on the specific requirements of the application:

1. **Biological Plausibility**: If biological plausibility is important (e.g., for neuroscience applications), NGC models would be preferred.

2. **Reconstruction Quality**: If pure reconstruction quality is the goal (e.g., for denoising or compression), RAE models typically perform best.

3. **Generative Modeling**: If the goal is to generate new samples or perform density estimation, VAE models are more suitable.

4. **Uncertainty Modeling**: If modeling uncertainty is important, VAE models with learned variance (like GVAE) are appropriate.

5. **Computational Efficiency**: If computational efficiency is a concern, RAE models are typically faster to train and evaluate than NGC models.

6. **Interpretability**: If interpretability in terms of predictive coding principles is desired, NGC models provide a clear framework.

7. **Balance of Reconstruction and Regularization**: If a balance between reconstruction quality and regularization is needed, GVAE-CV offers a good middle ground.

### 5.5 Advanced Topics

**Q14: How can NGC models be extended to handle more complex data types or tasks?**

A14: NGC models can be extended to handle more complex data types or tasks in several ways:

1. **Convolutional Architectures**: Incorporating convolutional layers to handle image data more effectively.

2. **Recurrent Connections**: Adding recurrent connections to model temporal dependencies in sequential data.

3. **Attention Mechanisms**: Incorporating attention mechanisms to focus on relevant parts of the input.

4. **Hierarchical Latent Variables**: Using hierarchical latent variable structures to capture different levels of abstraction.

5. **Conditional Generation**: Extending the models to perform conditional generation by incorporating label information.

6. **Multi-modal Learning**: Adapting the models to handle multiple modalities of data simultaneously.

7. **Transfer Learning**: Developing techniques for transfer learning to leverage pre-trained NGC models.

**Q15: What are the current limitations of NGC models and how might they be addressed in future research?**

A15: Current limitations of NGC models and potential future directions include:

1. **Scalability**: NGC models can be computationally expensive due to the iterative settling process. Future research could focus on more efficient implementations or approximations.

2. **Performance Gap**: There is still a performance gap compared to state-of-the-art backpropagation-based models. Future work could explore hybrid approaches or novel architectures to close this gap.

3. **Theoretical Understanding**: The theoretical understanding of NGC models is still developing. More rigorous analysis of their convergence properties and representational capacity would be valuable.

4. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: NGC models can be sensitive to hyperparameters. Developing more robust training procedures or automatic hyperparameter tuning methods would be beneficial.

5. **Integration with Other Approaches**: Exploring how NGC principles can be integrated with other successful approaches like transformers or graph neural networks.

6. **Hardware Implementation**: Developing specialized hardware that can efficiently implement the parallel, local computations required by NGC models.

7. **Biological Validation**: Conducting more extensive comparisons with neuroscience data to validate and refine the biological plausibility of NGC models.

**Q16: How do the different models compare in terms of their ability to learn disentangled representations?**

A16: The ability of different models to learn disentangled representations varies:

1. **VAEs**: VAEs with appropriate priors (e.g., $\beta$-VAE) can learn disentangled representations by encouraging independence between latent dimensions through a stronger KL divergence term.

2. **RAEs**: RAEs can learn disentangled representations through explicit regularization terms that encourage specific properties in the latent space, but they lack the probabilistic framework that naturally encourages disentanglement in VAEs.

3. **NGC Models**: NGC models can potentially learn disentangled representations through their hierarchical structure and predictive coding principles, but this is less well-studied compared to VAEs.

Factors that influence disentanglement include:
- The choice of prior distribution
- The strength of regularization
- The architecture of the model
- The nature of the data
- The specific training objective

Research suggests that while VAEs have a natural framework for disentanglement through the KL divergence term, achieving truly disentangled representations often requires additional constraints or supervision.
